            <h2> This Page </h2>
            <p> Welcome to ShadowyZephyr's corner of the internet! This is my personal website where I'm going to organize all my work and musings. I'm interested in CS, math, rationality, and want to learn! I'm new to web development, so don't expect much from this right now. I'll probably write more here later. </p>
            <h2> My Values </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Honesty: I believe honesty is important in relationships. If a friend asks how you are, they should be prepared to hear if you aren't okay. Also, if I constantly feel like you have to lie or "put on a mask" to be around someone, I won't want to interact with them often. </li>
                <li> Freedom of Opinion: I believe that people should not be cancelled or excommunicated over political opinions, and censorship of minority positions generally does more harm than good. An exception is if the position is actively threatening a group, ex. "Let's kill all the [insert minority group here]". Punishing or blacklisting people for having opinions doesn't change their opinions, it only makes them feel resentful, and creates a society where everyone is afraid to speak up for things they believe in.</li>
                <li> Rationality: I believe logos is the most important argumentative technique, and I try to look for statistics if they're available, instead of just believing anecdotes. I try not to let emotion influence my political positions too much, (although all humans fail at that from time to time).  </li>
            </ul>
